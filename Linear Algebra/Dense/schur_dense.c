// TODO: FINISH SCHUR FACTORIZATION

// Function for computing the Schur factorization of A i.e. A = QUQ^T
// where Q is unitary and U is upper triangular. This is useful as 
// A and U must be similar meaning that the eigenvalues of A must appear
// on the diagonal of U. Also unlike with eigendecomposition Schur factorization
// can be found for every square matrix A.
//int schur_dense(denseMatrix* A, denseMatrix* Q, denseMatrix* U) {}
